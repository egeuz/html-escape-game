        <p>You encounter the <b>NEGAFROG</b>, and it encounters you. It produces a single <b>RIBBIT.</b> As it rings in your ears, you realize that you feel every single oscillation of every single frequency of that single <b>RIBBIT</b> pass through your body, ripples of air creating tremors across the molecules that bind your existence, entropy precipitates and dissipates, an experience as intense as the first breath you've ever taken, and the last you ever will.</p>
        <p>You are compelled for more. You touch the <b>NEGAFROG.</b> It emits yet another <b>RIBBIT.</b> Reality breaks down around you, everything you know, and all the things you never will know melt into nothingness. Slowly every shell of the life we have constructed sheds away, revealing the universe in its entire beauty until the stars go dim in waves each time the <b>RIBBIT</b> echoes in your mind. There is now nothing, but you. The cycle has ended, and you are its sole witness. Resigned to fate, you close your eyes...</p>
        <p>...and open them to find themselves back to where you were, 10,000 days later. The <b>NEGAFROG</b> has left. As you rise to recover, something manifests in your mind: the one and only universal <b>TRUTH</b>, the <b>ANSWER</b> to all questions.</p>
        <p>It is a single word: <b>SOCIALISM.</b></p>
