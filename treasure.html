        <p>Inside the box, you find two <b>PEOPLE.</b> One of them introduces themselves as <b>BIG JIM</b>, while presenting his sole possession, a standard <b>KEY.</b> The other declares: "I AM LORD UNDERSHIRT, WIZARD ALMIGHTY. SET ME FREE, AND RECEIVE THIS VERY RARE <b>SCROLL OF SCROLLING.</b>"</p>
        <p>It almost appears as if you must now make a choice. The <b>KEY?</b> Or the <b>VERY RARE SCROLL OF SCROLLING?</b> After much thought, you decide to take both of them. The people do nothing, as they are small and malnourished from being inside of a box.</p>
        <p>You obtain the <b>KEY</b> and the <b>SCROLL OF SCROLLING.</b></p>
